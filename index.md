### CPSC 120

* Lab 9 (part-1)

Lab 9 part-1 was my favorite lab so far. This is because I finally feel as if I can
code things confidently. The use of for-each loops have made me confident 
in my ablity to code. Loops were always challenging for me but after this lab
I felt as if they were a useful tool. Besides this I really thought that the 
use of a spell check was a useful tool that would actually prove helpful in my
future.
