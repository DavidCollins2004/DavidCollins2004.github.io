### CPSC 120

* Lab 9 (part-1)

Lab 9 part-1 was my favorite lab so far. This is because I finally feel as if I can
code things confidently. The use of for-each loops have made me confident 
in my ability to code. Loops were always challenging for me but after this lab
I felt as if they were a useful tool. Besides this I really thought that the 
use of a spell check was a useful tool that would actually prove helpful in my
future. 

* Lab 1
Lab 1 has to be one of my favorite labs just the fact that figuring out a std::cout
command would be so difficult is uplifting to think about and how far all of us CPSC
120 students have made it. This Lab showed us a lot about how to code correctly nothing
was more difficult than trying to learn how to clone a github repository and simply
change the writing.

* Lab 11
Lab 11 has been one of my favorite labs so far. It has definitely been the most challenging
for me as a whole but with this lab came plenty of curiosity and want to understand
this type of coding with class types and such is very unique to me and helps me imagine
how all these complicated systems work.
